	* Motion Planning
	* State estimation

- Thesis
	PhD/Master thesis tends to be a very good portal to a specific research topic. Here is a collection of what might help.
	* OSQP is a pretty fast QP solver, which is also a good application of the ADMM algorithm
	[ADMM]

- Surveys
	* * [An introduction on mixed-integer nonlinear optimization](https://www.mcs.anl.gov/papers/P3060-1112.pdf) by Pietro Belotti et al..
